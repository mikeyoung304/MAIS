/**
 * Prisma Client Re-export Module
 *
 * This file re-exports everything from the Prisma 7 generated client.
 * In Prisma 7, the entry point changed from index.ts to client.ts.
 * This wrapper provides a stable import path that won't be overwritten
 * by `prisma generate`.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * // Instead of: import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'
 * import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from './db'
 * ```
 */

export * from './generated/prisma/client';
