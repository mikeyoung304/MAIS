## 1. Backup Files (Migration Artifacts)

These are backup files from previous development/migration phases. All are safe to delete.

| File Path | Type | Confidence | Deletion Eligible | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/scripts/test-api.sh.bak` | backup | HIGH | true | Backup of test script, no longer needed |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/src/adapters/mock/index.ts.bak` | backup | HIGH | true | Backup of mock adapter, superseded |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/.env.backup` | backup | HIGH | true | Environment backup, should not be committed |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/pages/Home.tsx.bak` | backup | HIGH | true | Backup of home page, superseded |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/pages/Success.tsx.old` | backup | HIGH | true | Old success page, superseded |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/pages/Home.tsx.backup` | backup | HIGH | true | Another backup of home page |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/test/integration/catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts.backup` | backup | HIGH | true | Test backup, superseded |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/features/admin/tenants/TenantForm.tsx.backup` | backup | HIGH | true | Tenant form backup, superseded |

---

## 2. Unused Components

### 2.1 ColorPicker.tsx - UNUSED

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Path | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/ColorPicker.tsx` |
| Type | component |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Deletion Eligible | true |
| Reason | Only references found are in the file itself and archived documentation. BrandingForm uses `ColorInput` from `./ColorInput` instead, not this component. |

### 2.2 MaconLogo.tsx - UNUSED

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Path | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/brand/MaconLogo.tsx` |
| Type | component |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Deletion Eligible | true |
| Reason | No imports found anywhere in the codebase. The codebase uses `Logo` from `./Logo.tsx` instead. |

### 2.3 PackagePhotoUploader.example.tsx - EXAMPLE FILE

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Path | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/PackagePhotoUploader.example.tsx` |
| Type | example |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Deletion Eligible | true |
| Reason | Example file for development documentation. Only referenced in markdown docs, never imported. Should be moved to docs or deleted. |

---

## 3. Duplicate Components

### 3.1 ErrorBoundary Components (Two Implementations)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| File 1 | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` |
| File 2 | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/errors/ErrorBoundary.tsx` |
| Type | duplicate |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |
| Deletion Eligible | true (File 1) |
| Reason | Two ErrorBoundary implementations exist. `main.tsx` imports from `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (File 1), while 11 feature pages import from `components/errors/`. File 1 appears to be a simpler standalone implementation. Recommend consolidating to `components/errors/ErrorBoundary.tsx`. |

### 3.2 ErrorAlert Components (Two Implementations)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| File 1 | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/ui/error-alert.tsx` |
| File 2 | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/shared/ErrorAlert.tsx` |
| Type | duplicate |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |
| Deletion Eligible | false (requires refactoring) |
| Reason | Two ErrorAlert implementations with different styling (File 1: dark theme, File 2: light theme). Both are used in different contexts. `shared/ErrorAlert.tsx` is used more broadly (8+ files). Consider consolidating with prop-based theming. |

---

## 4. Unused Exports (packages/shared)

### 4.1 Result Type - UNUSED

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Path | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/packages/shared/src/result.ts` |
| Export | `Result<T, E>` type |
| Type | export |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Deletion Eligible | false |
| Reason | Exported from shared package but never imported anywhere. However, it's part of the shared utilities package API - keep for future use but document as available. |

### 4.2 error-guards.ts - PARTIALLY USED

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Path | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/packages/shared/src/error-guards.ts` |
| Type | export |
| Confidence | LOW |
| Deletion Eligible | false |
| Reason | This file is not re-exported from `index.ts` (only `money`, `date`, `result` are exported). The guards are defined but not accessible via `@macon/shared`. Either add to index.ts or evaluate if needed. |

---

## 5. Temporary Files (Development Artifacts)

### 5.1 Email Sink Files

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Path | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/tmp/emails/*.eml` |
| Count | 100+ files |
| Type | temp |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Deletion Eligible | true |
| Reason | Test email files generated by mock mail provider. These accumulate during development/testing. Add to `.gitignore` if not already, and can be safely deleted periodically. |

---

## 6. Root-Level Documentation Files

### 6.1 SECURITY_REVIEW_useVisualEditor.md

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Path | `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/SECURITY_REVIEW_useVisualEditor.md` |
| Type | documentation |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |
| Deletion Eligible | true |
| Reason | Security review document at project root. Should be moved to `docs/security/` or `docs/archive/` for organization. The review is complete and findings addressed. |

---

## 7. Dead Routes / Unreachable Endpoints

**NONE FOUND** - All route files in `server/src/routes/` are properly mounted via:
- `app.ts` (health, metrics, CSP, dev routes, webhooks)
- `routes/index.ts` (all API v1 routes)

All routes are appropriately mounted and accessible.

---

## 8. Unused Environment Variables

**NONE FOUND** - All environment variables referenced in the codebase have corresponding usage.

---

## 9. Abandoned TODO Files

The following TODO files exist in the docs folder but are appropriately archived:

| Path | Status |
|------|--------|
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/docs/archive/2025-11/analysis/TODO_TESTS_*.md` | Archived - historical |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/docs/archive/2024-12-solutions-cleanup/TODO-*.md` | Archived - historical |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/docs/solutions/TODO-RESOLUTION-*.md` | Active - workflow documentation |
| `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/docs/solutions/TODO-STALENESS-PREVENTION.md` | Active - prevention strategy |

These are appropriately organized and not orphaned.

---

## 10. Clean-Up Recommendations

### Priority 1 - Safe to Delete Immediately
1. All 8 backup files (`.bak`, `.backup`, `.old`)
2. `ColorPicker.tsx` - completely unused
3. `MaconLogo.tsx` - completely unused
4. `PackagePhotoUploader.example.tsx` - move to docs or delete
5. Email temp files in `server/tmp/emails/`

### Priority 2 - Consolidate Duplicates
1. Consolidate ErrorBoundary to `components/errors/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
2. Consolidate ErrorAlert to single component with theme prop

### Priority 3 - Documentation Organization
1. Move `SECURITY_REVIEW_useVisualEditor.md` to `docs/security/`
2. Add `error-guards.ts` to shared package exports if needed

---

## Deletion Commands

```bash
# Priority 1: Remove backup files
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/scripts/test-api.sh.bak
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/src/adapters/mock/index.ts.bak
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/.env.backup
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/pages/Home.tsx.bak
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/pages/Success.tsx.old
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/pages/Home.tsx.backup
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/test/integration/catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts.backup
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/features/admin/tenants/TenantForm.tsx.backup

# Priority 1: Remove unused components
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/ColorPicker.tsx
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/brand/MaconLogo.tsx
rm /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/client/src/components/PackagePhotoUploader.example.tsx

# Priority 1: Clear email temp files
rm -rf /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/tmp/emails/*

mv /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/SECURITY_REVIEW_useVisualEditor.md /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/docs/security/
```

## Notes

1. **No critical orphans found** - The codebase is relatively clean with good organization.
2. **Shared package exports** - The `@macon/shared` package only exports `money`, `date`, and `result`. The `error-guards.ts` file exists but is not exported.
3. **Apps/web components** - All components in `apps/web/src/components/` are properly imported and used.
4. **Contracts package** - All exports from `@macon/contracts` are utilized in the codebase.
