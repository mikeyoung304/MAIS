# Rebrand Summary: MAIS → HANDLED

**Date:** December 27, 2025
**Status:** Decision Made — Ready for Implementation

---

## The Decision

**Old Name:** Macon AI Solutions (MAIS)
**New Name:** HANDLED

---

## Why We're Rebranding

"Macon AI Solutions" has several problems:
- Sounds like a 2008 regional IT consultancy
- "Solutions" is a credibility killer with modern audiences
- Geographic tie (Macon) limits national ambitions
- Leading with "AI" puts us in a crowded, often-mocked category

---

## What HANDLED Offers

### Core Infrastructure
1. **Done-for-you website** — We build it for them
2. **AI chatbot** — Helps with pricing, offerings, client questions
3. **Storefront with booking/payments** — Clients book and pay automatically
4. **Ongoing tech management** — They never touch the tech

### Community Layer
5. **Monthly AI Zoom calls** — Members discuss AI tools that work
6. **Monthly newsletter** — Curated AI tips and tools

### Target Customer
Service-based business owners: photographers, coaches, therapists, wedding planners. People overwhelmed by tech who want to focus on their craft.

---

## The Brand Package

### Taglines (pick your favorite)
1. "Your tech. Handled."
2. "Tech chaos? Handled."
3. "Your business, beautifully handled."
4. "From overwhelmed to overbooked."
5. "You do the work. We do the rest."

### Primary Tagline
**"Your tech. Handled."**

### Hero Headline (homepage)
**"Finally. Your tech is handled."**

*Subhead: "Websites, booking, payments, and AI—built and managed for service businesses who'd rather focus on their craft."*

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> "You know how photographers and coaches spend half their time wrestling with websites, payment systems, and all that tech stuff instead of actually serving clients? We handle all of it. Website, booking, payments, even an AI chatbot that answers questions while you sleep. You focus on your craft—we keep the machine running. It's like having a tech department, but you actually like them."

### Party Line (10 seconds)
> "We're a tech team for small service businesses. Website, booking, the whole thing. We build it, we run it, you just show up and do your job."

### Twitter/X Bio
> "Done-for-you websites, booking & AI for service pros. You do the work. We handle the rest. For photographers, coaches & makers who hate tech chaos."

### Membership Tier Names
- **Starter:** "Handled Lite"
- **Growth:** "Fully Handled"
- **Pro:** "White Glove"

## Domain Strategy

### Recommended Options (in priority order)
| Priority | Domain | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | handled.io | Clean, tech-forward |
| 2 | itshandled.com | Memorable phrase |
| 3 | handled.co | Short, modern |
| 4 | handledtech.com | Backup option |
| 5 | stayhandled.com | Ongoing relationship angle |

### Domains to Avoid
- **handled.com** — Parked, expensive ($10K-50K)
- **gethandled.com** — Exists (redirects to landing page)

### Social Handle Strategy
- Twitter/X: @gethandled or @handledHQ
- Instagram: @gethandled or @handled.co
- TikTok: @gethandled
- LinkedIn: /company/gethandled

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitor Check
| Name | What They Do | Threat Level |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Handlr (myhandlr.com) | Pet sitters, dog walkers app | LOW — narrow niche, different spelling |

### Why HANDLED is Safe
- Handlr targets a very specific vertical (pet services)
- Different spelling eliminates trademark conflict
- Our positioning (full business tech stack) is distinct
- "Handled" as a word is common enough to coexist

---

## Names Considered & Rejected

### Final Three
| Name | Why Rejected |
|------|--------------|
| SIDEWORK | Namespace crowded — VC-backed beverage company owns sidework.co, gig app owns getsidework.com |
| SORTED | sorted.com owned by 100+ employee delivery SaaS; British slang limits US appeal |

### Earlier Candidates
| Name | Why Rejected |
|------|--------------|
| TENDED | $14.4M funded UK safety tech company at tended.co.uk |
| FRONTLINE | Extremely saturated namespace |
| LEAN | Owned by Lean Startup methodology |
| CRAFT | Colonized by maker/artisan tools |
| THE GIST | theGist.ai, gist.ai, multiple competitors |
| SIGNAL | Signal AI, The Signal newsletter, Alpha Signal — claimed territory |

## The Rebrand Process

### Agencies Consulted
We ran parallel consultations with 7 marketing perspectives:

1. **Velocity Labs** — Silicon Valley startup energy
2. **Sterling & Associates** — Brand identity specialists
3. **Main Street Marketing** — Small business focus
4. **Maison Blanc** — Luxury/premium positioning
5. **Campfire Collective** — Storytelling/narrative
6. **Wordsmith & Co.** — Naming linguistics specialists
7. **The Provocateurs** — Bold/creative agency
8. **Practical Partners** — No-nonsense Midwest branding

### Key Insights from Process
- Clean namespace is more valuable than "perfect" name
- Past-tense verbs (handled, sorted, built) communicate completion
- The target audience wants relief, not empowerment
- "AI" should be a feature, not the headline

## Brand Voice (Brief)

### Personality
- **Confident but not arrogant** — "It's handled" not "We're the best"
- **Relief-focused** — We solve the stress, not add features
- **Human** — Real team, not faceless platform
- **Slightly irreverent** — Can be witty, never corporate

### What We Say
- "Your tech. Handled."
- "You focus on your craft"
- "We keep the machine running"
- "Like having a tech department you actually like"

### What We Don't Say
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing" / "Disruptive"
- "AI-powered" as the lead (it's a feature, not the headline)
- "Solutions" / "Synergy" / corporate buzzwords
- Anything that sounds like 2015 startup speak

2. **Brand identity brief** — For designer
3. **Codebase updates** — MAIS → Handled
4. **Landing page copy** — First impression matters
