# StoryBrand Framework Audit: Macon AI Solutions

> **Date:** November 24, 2025
> **Framework:** Donald Miller's StoryBrand 7-Part Framework (SB7)
> **Current State:** Marketing messaging lacks clarity and emotional resonance

---

## Executive Summary

Macon AI Solutions has a **strong product** but **weak brand story**. The current messaging focuses on features and capabilities rather than positioning the customer as the hero. Using the StoryBrand framework, we've identified critical gaps that are likely hurting conversion rates.

**Key Finding:** Your customer should be Luke Skywalker. You should be Yoda. Currently, Macon AI is trying to be both.

---

## The StoryBrand Framework (SB7)

The 7 elements of a clear brand story:

1. **A Character** (the customer)
2. **Has a Problem** (external, internal, philosophical)
3. **And Meets a Guide** (your brand)
4. **Who Gives Them a Plan** (clear steps)
5. **And Calls Them to Action** (direct & transitional CTAs)
6. **That Helps Them Avoid Failure** (stakes)
7. **And Ends in Success** (transformation)

---

## Current State Analysis

### 1. CHARACTER (The Hero) - GRADE: C+

**What You Have:**

- Three persona types defined (Solopreneur, Scaling Startup, Pivot Artist)
- Basic problem statements for each

**What's Missing:**

- **Specific identity language** - You describe what they do, not who they are
- **Emotional state** - No acknowledgment of how they _feel_ (overwhelmed, frustrated, stuck)
- **Aspirational identity** - Who do they want to become?

**Current Copy:**

> "You're wearing all the hats (sales, marketing, ops) and drowning in admin."

**StoryBrand Fix:**

> "You didn't start your business to spend 60 hours a week on admin. You started it to build something meaningful—and you're losing that spark every day."

---

### 2. THE PROBLEM - GRADE: D

This is your biggest weakness. StoryBrand defines three levels of problems:

| Problem Type      | Definition                      | Your Current State  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **External**      | The tangible problem they face  | Mentioned but vague |
| **Internal**      | How the problem makes them feel | Missing entirely    |
| **Philosophical** | Why it's just plain wrong       | Missing entirely    |

**Current External Problem (implied):**

- Too much admin work
- No booking system
- Losing leads
- No website

**Missing Internal Problem:**

- Feeling like a fraud
- Imposter syndrome when competitors have polished systems
- Guilt about neglecting core business
- Fear of falling behind

**Missing Philosophical Problem:**

- "Small business owners shouldn't have to choose between doing their craft and running their business."
- "The best service providers shouldn't lose to competitors with better marketing."
- "Your expertise deserves the infrastructure that lets it shine."

**Recommendation:** Add a dedicated "Problem" section BEFORE your features section. Make visitors feel seen before you sell them.

---

### 3. THE GUIDE (Your Brand) - GRADE: B-

**What You Have:**

- "Dedicated AI strategist" messaging
- "We execute alongside you" positioning
- Revenue-sharing model (aligned incentives)

**What's Missing:**

- **Empathy statements** - "We've been there" (you mention this once in About section, needs to be front and center)
- **Authority markers** - Credentials, certifications, track record
- **Specificity** - What exactly makes your AI strategists qualified?

**Current:**

> "We don't just give you tools—we execute alongside you."

**StoryBrand Fix:**

> "We've helped 50+ business owners escape the admin trap. Our AI strategists have [X combined years] of experience turning chaos into systems. We know what you're going through because we've built businesses ourselves."

**Guide Positioning Formula:**

```
Empathy ("We understand...") + Authority ("We've helped X customers achieve Y")
```

---

### 4. THE PLAN - GRADE: B

**What You Have:**
Your "How It Works" section is actually decent:

1. Apply & Onboard (Week 1)
2. Tailored Plan (Week 2-3)
3. Revenue Partnership (Ongoing)

**What's Missing:**

- **Named Plan** - Give it a memorable name (e.g., "The Growth Partnership Method")
- **Specificity** - What happens in each step?
- **Risk Removal** - Where's the guarantee?

**Current:**

> "We assess your needs, then set up booking/scheduling, marketing automation, and consulting as you require."

**StoryBrand Fix:**

> **Step 1: Discovery Call** (30 minutes)
> We'll audit your current systems, identify revenue leaks, and show you exactly where we can help.
>
> **Step 2: Custom Blueprint** (1 week)
> Your dedicated strategist builds your personalized growth plan—booking system, website, marketing automation tailored to YOUR business.
>
> **Step 3: Launch & Partner** (Week 2+)
> We implement everything. You focus on clients. We share in your success—no monthly fees, just aligned incentives.

**The Plan should answer:** "What are the 3-4 steps I need to take to work with you?"

---

### 5. CALLS TO ACTION - GRADE: C

StoryBrand distinguishes between:

- **Direct CTAs** - "Buy Now," "Schedule a Call," "Start Free Trial"
- **Transitional CTAs** - "Download the Guide," "Watch Demo," "Take the Quiz"

**Your Current CTAs:**
| CTA | Type | Location | Issue |
|-----|------|----------|-------|
| "Browse Packages" | Direct | Hero, How It Works, Final | Unclear what happens next |
| "How It Works" | Transitional | Hero | Good, but links to section not separate content |
| "Chat with us" | Transitional | Target Audience | Good for low-intent |

**Problems:**

1. **No clear primary direct CTA** - "Browse Packages" is passive, not action-oriented
2. **No lead magnet** - Where's your transitional CTA for people not ready to buy?
3. **Redundancy** - Same CTA 3x doesn't add value

**StoryBrand Fix:**

**Direct CTA (Primary):**

> "Start My Growth Audit" or "Schedule My Free Strategy Call"

**Transitional CTA (Secondary):**

> "Download: The Small Business Owner's Guide to Escaping the Admin Trap" (free PDF)

**CTAs should be:**

- Clear about what happens when clicked
- Repeated, but with variation
- Both direct AND transitional options

---

### 6. FAILURE (Stakes) - GRADE: F

**This is completely missing from your messaging.**

StoryBrand says: If nothing is at stake, the story doesn't matter.

**What failure looks like for your customer:**

- Continue losing leads to competitors with better systems
- Burn out from 70-hour weeks
- Watch your business stagnate while you drown in admin
- Become a technician forever, never a business owner
- Miss your kids' events because you're manually sending reminders

**Current messaging:** Zero mention of consequences of inaction.

**Recommendation:** Add a subtle "What's at stake" section or weave failure into your problem section.

**Example copy:**

> "Every day without systems is a day you lose leads to competitors who have them. The solopreneur who tries to do it all alone eventually burns out—or gets left behind."

---

### 7. SUCCESS (Transformation) - GRADE: B-

**What You Have:**

- Outcome statements on feature cards ("Save 60+ hours/month")
- Testimonials showing transformation
- Revenue-sharing alignment messaging

**What's Missing:**

- **Visual success** - What does life look like after?
- **Emotional payoff** - How do they FEEL when successful?
- **Identity transformation** - Who do they become?

**Current:**

> "Increase revenue, land more clients, scale smarter"

**StoryBrand Fix:**

> "Imagine opening your calendar on Monday morning and seeing a full week of booked clients—none of whom you had to chase. Your website looks professional. Your payments process automatically. You finally have time to take your kids to school. That's what membership looks like."

**Success should paint a picture** of the "after" state, not just list benefits.
