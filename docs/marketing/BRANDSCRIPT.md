## The BrandScript

### 1. CHARACTER (The Hero)

**Who they are:**
A business owner who started their company to do meaningful work—but now spends more time on admin than on what they love.

**How they feel:**

- Overwhelmed by scheduling, invoices, and follow-ups
- Like a fraud when competitors have polished systems
- Exhausted from wearing every hat
- Afraid of falling behind

**What they want:**
To run a business that runs itself—so they can focus on their craft and their life.

| Drowning in admin            | Systems handle it         |
| Chasing leads manually       | Calendar fills itself     |
| No professional web presence | Website that converts     |
| Working 70-hour weeks        | Time for craft and family |
