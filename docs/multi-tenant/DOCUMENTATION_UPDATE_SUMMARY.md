## Archived Documentation

The following files were already archived to `docs/archive/2025-11/planning/`:

- `MULTI_TENANCY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Historical implementation plan (Phase 1 complete)
- `MULTI_TENANCY_READINESS_REPORT.md` - Initial assessment from November 2025

These documents were point-in-time assessments and are no longer current. They have been properly archived and README.md now points to their archive location.

## Key Findings

### What Was Outdated:

1. **Completion percentages** - Documents showed "6/10 maturity" when actual is 7/10
2. **Phase status** - Multiple docs said "Phase 1 complete, waiting for DB" when Phases 1-4 are done
3. **Branch references** - Documents referenced `multi-tenant-embeddable` branch when code is on `main`
4. **Dates** - Some docs showed November 2024 dates when work was done in November 2025
5. **Missing features** - Package photo uploads were listed as "missing" when they're complete

### What's Now Accurate:

1. ✅ All docs show 95% architecture completion
2. ✅ All docs show Phase 5 in progress (33% complete)
3. ✅ Package photo uploads marked as COMPLETE
4. ✅ Correct branch references (`main` instead of `multi-tenant-embeddable`)
5. ✅ Accurate dates (November 2025 start, December 2025 current)
6. ✅ Links to archived historical documents corrected

## Recommendations

### No Further Action Needed:

The multi-tenant documentation is now current and accurate. All reference materials are up to date.

### Future Maintenance:

Update these docs when:

1. Phase 5 features complete (update progress percentages)
2. Phase 6 begins (update current phase)
3. Architecture maturity score changes (currently 7/10, goal 9/10)
4. Major milestones reached (e.g., 10+ tenants onboarded)
