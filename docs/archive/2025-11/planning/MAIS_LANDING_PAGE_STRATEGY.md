  - Small Body (captions, labels): 14px desktop / 14px mobile
- **Line Height:** 1.6 for body (optimal readability for long-form content)
- **Letter Spacing:** Default (0em)

**Accent Font (Minimal Use):**

**Cormorant Garamond (Italic)**

- **Why:** Elegant serif adds wedding context without being overly decorative
- **Weights:** Italic (400)
- **Usage:** Pull quotes, testimonial emphasis, decorative subheadlines (use sparingly!)
- **Size:** 24px-32px
- **Example:** Opening quotation marks in testimonial cards, "Loved by..." subheadline

**Typography System (Responsive):**

| Element      | Desktop         | Tablet          | Mobile          |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| H1 (Hero)    | 72px / Bold     | 56px / Bold     | 48px / Bold     |
| H2 (Section) | 48px / Bold     | 40px / Bold     | 36px / Bold     |

**Font Loading Strategy:**

- **Method:** Google Fonts with `font-display: swap` (prevent FOIT/FOUT)
- **Preconnect:** `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">`
- **Subset:** Latin character set only (reduce file size)
- **Fallback Stack:**
  - DM Sans: `'DM Sans', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
  - Inter: `'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif`

### Visual Style Guidelines

**Overall Aesthetic:**

- **80% Professional, 20% Wedding Context**
- **Elevated professionalism** (not corporate sterile, not whimsical romantic)
- **Clean, modern, approachable** (think Apple, not Adobe)
- **Data-driven** (charts, metrics, specificity build trust)

**Design Principles:**

1. **Generous White Space:** 80-100px vertical padding between sections
2. **Subtle Animations:** Hover states, scroll-triggered entrances (not distracting)
3. **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear heading structure, F-pattern layout
4. **Consistency:** Repeated card patterns, uniform CTA styling
5. **Mobile-First:** Touch-friendly targets (48px min), readable text (16px min)

**Micro-Interactions:**

- **Card Hover:** Slight lift (-4px translate) + shadow increase + border color change
- **Button Hover:** Dusty rose → darker dusty rose (#C89494) + subtle scale (1.02x)
- **Icon Animations:** Rotate 5° on hover (feature icons), scale 1.1x
- **Scroll Animations:** Fade in + slide up 20px (stagger for card grids)

## Visual Asset Requirements

### Photography Style

**Primary Focus: Professional B2B Context (NOT couple-focused romantic imagery)**

**Do's:**

- ✅ Venue owners/managers working on laptops (behind-the-scenes professionalism)
- ✅ Empty venue spaces (corporate photography style: well-lit, architectural)
- ✅ Professional headshots (venue owners for testimonials: confident, approachable)
- ✅ Software dashboard screenshots (clean, annotated with arrows/highlights)
- ✅ Data visualization (charts showing time saved, revenue increased)
- ✅ Team collaboration (staff reviewing calendar, discussing leads)

**Don'ts:**

- ❌ Couple-focused romantic shots (confuses B2B positioning)
- ❌ Wedding ceremony imagery (save for customer case studies only)
- ❌ Stock photos that scream "stock photo" (overly posed, cheesy smiles)
- ❌ Dark/moody photography (doesn't convey efficiency and professionalism)

**Specific Asset Needs:**

**1. Hero Section Visual (1)**

- **Type:** Split-screen or dashboard mockup
- **Option A:** Venue owner (30s-50s, professional attire) reviewing MAIS dashboard on laptop at venue desk (natural light, shallow depth of field)

**3. Feature Highlight Screenshots (6-8)**

- One screenshot per feature (unified lead dashboard, smart calendar, payment processing, packages, automation, reporting, client portal, mobile app)
- **Dimensions:** 1000x750px each
- **Treatment:** Clean UI screenshots with contextual annotations, consistent styling

**4. Case Study Photos (3)**

- **Type:** Professional headshots of venue owners (Sarah M., Marcus T., Linda K.)

- **Dimensions:** 400x400px (square crop for testimonial cards)
- **Bonus:** Optional video testimonial thumbnails (play button overlay)

**5. Testimonial Showcase Photos (6-9)**

- **Type:** Mix of headshots + venue logos (if available)
- **Dimensions:** 300x300px headshots, variable logo sizes
- **Style:** Circular crop for headshots, grayscale logos for visual consistency

**6. Visual Icons (30-40)**

- **Type:** Line-style icons (consistent stroke weight: 2px)
- **Categories:** Features, pain points, benefits, trust badges

- **Examples:** Dashboard icon, calendar icon, credit card, bell, chart, mobile phone, lock (security), checkmark, star (rating), clock (time savings)
- **Source:** Heroicons, Lucide Icons, or custom illustrations

**7. Background Textures (Optional, 2-3)**

- **Type:** Subtle patterns for section backgrounds (avoid distraction)
- **Examples:** Faint grid pattern, soft gradient overlay, organic shapes (blurred)
- **Opacity:** 5-10% (barely visible, adds depth without competing with content)

**8. Trust Badges/Logos (10-15)**

- **Security Badges:** SSL certificate, PCI compliance, GDPR compliant, SOC 2 certified
- **Review Platforms:** Capterra stars, WeddingWire partner badge, G2 ratings
- **Client Logos:** 6-10 recognizable venue brands (grayscale for consistency)
- **Media Mentions:** If applicable (e.g., "Featured in Bridal Guide", "WeddingWire Partner")

---

### Video Assets (Recommended)

**1. Hero Section Demo Video (2 minutes)**

- **Content:** Quick walkthrough of MAIS (lead capture → calendar booking → payment)
- **Style:** Screen recording with voiceover (professional, upbeat female or male voice)
- **Treatment:** Embedded video player (play button overlay, auto-play muted on scroll)
- **CTA Endpoint:** "Start your free trial at elope3.com"

**2. Customer Testimonial Videos (3x 60-90 seconds)**

- **Format:** Interview-style (venue owner in their space, B-roll of venue)
- **Questions:** What was your biggest challenge? How did MAIS help? What results did you see?
- **Treatment:** Subtitled (critical for accessibility and silent autoplay), branded lower-thirds
- **Placement:** Testimonial section (carousel or grid)

**3. Feature Deep-Dives (Optional, 6x 30-60 seconds)**

- **Content:** One feature per video (e.g., "How Smart Calendar Prevents Double-Bookings")

---

## Trust-Building Elements

### 1. Security & Compliance Badges

**Why:** Reduce anxiety about data security and payment safety (critical for B2B SaaS).

**Implementation:**

- Display in footer (always visible) and near payment/pricing sections
- Badges to include:
  - **SSL Certificate** (lock icon + "256-bit encryption")
  - **PCI DSS Compliant** (payment security standard)
  - **GDPR Compliant** (data privacy)
  - **SOC 2 Certified** (security audit certification)
  - **Nightly Backups** (data protection)
- Link each badge to explanation page or certificate (transparency builds trust)

**Visual Treatment:**

- Grayscale logos (consistent styling)
- Small size (80x60px each)
- Horizontal row with equal spacing
- Hover: Tooltip with brief explanation

---

### 2. Customer Logos (Social Proof Wall)

**Why:** "Others like you trust us" reduces perceived risk.

**Implementation:**

- Display in social proof strip (below hero) and above final CTA
- **6-10 logos** of recognizable wedding venues/brands
- **Headline:** "Trusted by 200+ venues including..."
- Logos should be:
  - Grayscale (consistent visual style)
  - Equal height (not width—maintains aspect ratio)
  - Clickable to case study (if available)

**Visual Treatment:**

- Horizontal scrolling carousel (mobile)
- Static grid (desktop)
- Subtle opacity: 60% resting, 100% on hover

---

### 3. Review Aggregation & Ratings

**Why:** Third-party validation is 4x more trusted than self-reported claims.

**Implementation:**

- Display in social proof strip, testimonial section header, footer
- **Platforms to showcase:**
  - Capterra: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.8 out of 5 (200+ reviews)"
  - G2: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.9 out of 5 (150+ reviews)"
  - WeddingWire: "Rated #1 Venue Management Software"
  - Google Reviews: "4.9★ on Google (300+ reviews)"
- Link to review platform profiles (build credibility through transparency)

**Visual Treatment:**

- Star rating icon (muted gold #C9A961)
- Rating number + review count displayed inline
- Platform logo next to rating

---

### 4. Specific Metrics & Data

**Why:** Vague claims ("save time") are weak. Specific numbers build credibility.

**Implementation:**

- Use throughout landing page (hero, case studies, testimonials, FAQ)
- **Examples:**
  - "Save 62+ hours/month on admin work"
  - "Increase bookings by 30-40% on average"
  - "Zero double-bookings in 10,000+ managed weddings"
  - "Average inquiry-to-booking time: 7 minutes (was 7 days)"
  - "Payment collection reduced from 45 days → 12 days"
- Source data from actual customer results (anonymized if needed)

**Visual Treatment:**

- Large, bold numbers (DM Sans Bold, 48px+)
- Gradient text effect (optional, dusty rose to muted gold)
- Context below number ("hours saved monthly", "booking increase")

---

### 5. Case Studies with Before/After

**Why:** Stories are 22x more memorable than facts alone. Before/after creates tangible proof.

**Implementation:**

- Three full case studies in dedicated section (150-200 words each)
- Structure:
  1. **Context:** Venue name, size, location, challenge
  2. **Before:** Specific pain points, quantified struggle
  3. **After:** Results with numbers (time saved, revenue increased, stress reduced)
  4. **Quote:** First-person testimonial from owner/manager
  5. **Visual:** Photo of venue owner + venue logo
- Optional: Link to full case study PDF or video

**Visual Treatment:**

- Three-column grid (desktop), single-column stack (mobile)
- White cards with subtle shadow
- Before/after metrics displayed prominently (red → green, or gray → dusty rose)

---

### 6. Video Testimonials

**Why:** Video is 5x more engaging than text. Seeing real people builds emotional connection.

**Implementation:**

- Embed 2-3 video testimonials in testimonial section
- **Format:** 60-90 second interviews with venue owners
- **Content:** What was your challenge? How did MAIS help? What results did you see?
- **Production Quality:** Professional (lapel mic, good lighting) but not overly polished (authenticity matters)
- **Accessibility:** Subtitles required (critical for silent autoplay and accessibility)

**Visual Treatment:**

- Thumbnail with play button overlay
- Auto-play muted on scroll (stops when off-screen)
- Full-screen modal on click (for focused viewing)

---

### 7. Live Support & Contact Information

**Why:** Knowing help is available reduces purchase anxiety.

**Implementation:**

- **Live Chat Widget:** Bottom-right corner, always visible (Intercom, Drift, or similar)
  - Greeting: "Have questions? We're here to help!"
  - Response time: <2hr during business hours
- **Support Email:** Displayed in footer (e.g., support@elope3.com)
- **Phone Number:** Optional (increases trust but requires staffing)
- **Knowledge Base Link:** "Help Center" in navigation (self-service option)

**Visual Treatment:**

- Chat widget: Dusty rose (#D4A5A5) bubble with white icon
- Hover: Expand to show greeting message
- Mobile: Fixed position (doesn't interfere with scrolling)

---

### 8. Free Trial + Risk Reversal

**Why:** Removes financial risk from decision-making process.

**Implementation:**

- **30-Day Free Trial** (no credit card required)
  - Headline: "Try every feature free for 30 days—no credit card, no commitment"
  - CTA: "Start Free Trial" (not "Sign Up")
- **Money-Back Guarantee:**
  - "If MAIS doesn't save you 10+ hours in your first month, we'll refund your first payment—no questions asked."
- **No Contracts:**
  - "Cancel anytime with one click. No cancellation fees, no hassle. Export your data and go."

**Visual Treatment:**

- Display near pricing and final CTA sections
- Use checkmark icons (✓) for trust reinforcement
- Light background (warm gray) to separate from surrounding content

---

### 9. Founder Story / About Section (Optional)

**Why:** Humanizes brand, explains motivation, builds connection.

**Implementation:**

- Short section (100-150 words) above final CTA or in footer
- **Content:**
  - "We built MAIS because we've been there. After managing a wedding venue for 5 years, we knew there had to be a better way than spreadsheets and email chaos. So we built the tool we wished we had—and now we're sharing it with venue owners like you."
- **Visual:** Photo of founder(s) at venue or with laptop (authentic, not stock photo)

**Visual Treatment:**

- Two-column layout: Photo left, text right (desktop)
- Stack vertically on mobile
- Soft navy background with white text

---

### 10. Regular Updates & Roadmap Transparency

**Why:** Shows commitment to product improvement and customer success.

**Implementation:**

- **Recent Updates Section (Footer or About):**
  - "New features added this month: Email templates, QuickBooks integration, mobile app dark mode"
- **Public Roadmap Link:**
  - "See what we're building next →" (links to Trello board or feature request portal)
- **Customer-Driven Development:**
  - "We build what our customers need. Request a feature anytime—we listen."

**Visual Treatment:**

- Small section in footer or dedicated "What's New" modal
- Icon: Rocket or sparkle (suggests innovation)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Couple-Focused Imagery (Confuses B2B Positioning)

**Mistake:**
Using romantic wedding photography (couples kissing, ceremony moments, bridal portraits) as primary imagery.

**Why It's a Problem:**

- **Target audience is venue owners/planners, not couples getting married**
- Creates confusion: "Is this a tool for couples or for venue managers?"
- Undermines professional positioning (looks like B2C wedding planning app)
- Emotional wedding imagery distracts from efficiency/ROI messaging

**Fix:**

- Use **behind-the-scenes professional imagery**: venue owners working, empty venue spaces, software dashboards
- Reserve wedding imagery for customer case studies only (and even then, focus on venue owner testimonials, not couples)
- **80/20 Rule:** 80% professional/business context, 20% wedding context (subtle touches like dusty rose color, elegant typography)

**Example:**

- ❌ Hero image: Bride and groom walking down aisle
- ✅ Hero image: Venue manager reviewing MAIS dashboard on laptop at venue desk

---

### 2. Too Much Jargon / Feature-Focused (Not Outcome-Focused)

**Mistake:**
Leading with technical features instead of customer outcomes.

**Bad Example:**

> "MAIS features an advanced CRM with Zapier integration, RESTful API access, and multi-tenant architecture with role-based permissions."

**Why It's a Problem:**

- Venue owners care about **results** (time saved, bookings increased), not technical specs
- Jargon creates cognitive load ("What is a RESTful API?" → bounce)
- Sounds complicated, contradicts "simplicity" positioning

**Fix:**

- Lead with **outcomes**, support with **how**
- Translate features into benefits: "Advanced CRM" → "Never lose a lead again"
- Use plain language: "Connects with your favorite tools" instead of "Zapier integration"

**Better Example:**

> "MAIS captures every inquiry, prevents double-bookings, and automates payment collection—saving venue owners 60+ hours monthly."

**Rule:** Every feature mention must answer "So what? What does this mean for me?"

---

### 3. Multiple CTAs with Equal Weight (Choice Paralysis)

**Mistake:**
Presenting too many calls-to-action with no clear hierarchy.

**Bad Example:**

```
[Start Free Trial] [Request Demo] [View Pricing] [Download Whitepaper] [Contact Sales]
```

**Why It's a Problem:**

- **Choice paralysis:** More options = lower conversion (proven by Hick's Law)
- No clear next step → visitor bounces
- Dilutes focus of landing page

**Fix:**

- **One primary CTA** per section (repeated throughout page)
- **One secondary CTA** (complementary, not competing)
- Clear visual hierarchy: Primary CTA bold/colored, secondary CTA ghost/outline

**Better Example:**

```
[Start Free 30-Day Trial] ← Primary (dusty rose button)
Watch 2-Minute Demo → ← Secondary (text link with arrow)
```

**CTA Strategy:**

- Hero: Primary = "Start Free Trial", Secondary = "Watch Demo"
- Features: Primary = "Start Free Trial", Secondary = "Learn More →"
- Pricing: Primary = "Start Free Trial", Secondary = "Schedule Demo" (for Enterprise tier only)
- Final CTA: Primary = "Start Free Trial", no secondary (laser focus)

---

### 4. Hiding Pricing / No Transparency (Creates Distrust)

**Mistake:**
Requiring demo request or sales call to see pricing.

**Example:**

> "Contact us for pricing" or "Request a quote"

**Why It's a Problem:**

- Creates friction and distrust ("What are they hiding?")
- Self-service buyers bounce (80% of B2B buyers prefer to research independently)
- Competitors with transparent pricing win by default

**Fix:**

- Display **clear, transparent pricing** on landing page (even if it's a range)
- For custom/enterprise tiers: "Starting at $299/month" (gives ballpark)
- Use risk-reversal to reduce price anxiety: "30-day free trial", "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime"

**Better Example:**

```
Starter: $79/month
Professional: $149/month (Most Popular)
Enterprise: Starting at $299/month (Schedule Demo)
```

**Exception:** If pricing is truly variable (e.g., depends on number of venues), use ROI calculator to provide personalized estimate.

---

### 5. No Social Proof / Weak Trust Signals

**Mistake:**
Making claims without third-party validation.

**Bad Example:**

> "MAIS is the best wedding venue software. Our platform is amazing. You'll love it."

**Why It's a Problem:**

- Self-serving claims are ignored (everyone says they're the best)
- No credibility without proof
- Visitors need external validation (reviews, case studies, logos)

**Fix:**

- **Lead with social proof:** Customer logos, review ratings, specific metrics
- **Use third-party validation:** Capterra stars, WeddingWire ratings, media mentions
- **Quantify results:** "200+ venues", "10,000+ weddings managed", "4.8★ rating"
- **Include testimonials** throughout page (not just one section)

**Better Example:**

> "Trusted by 200+ wedding venues | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.8 on Capterra (150+ reviews) | 10,000+ weddings managed"

---

### 6. Generic Stock Photography (Lacks Authenticity)

**Mistake:**
Using overly polished, obviously fake stock photos.

**Example:**

- Diverse group of 20-somethings high-fiving in modern office
- Business person in suit pointing at tablet with exaggerated smile
- Generic "teamwork" imagery with no context

**Why It's a Problem:**

- Screams "stock photo" → reduces credibility
- No connection to wedding industry context
- Looks lazy (didn't invest in custom photography)

**Fix:**

- Use **custom photography** of actual venue spaces, real customers (with permission)
- If using stock: Choose realistic, contextual images (venue owner at desk, empty venue space)
- Prioritize **software screenshots** over people photos (shows actual product)

**Better Example:**

- Real photo of Garden Oasis Venue (customer) with owner testimonial
- Clean screenshot of MAIS dashboard (annotated)
- Behind-the-scenes photo of venue manager using laptop (natural, not posed)

---

### 7. Wall of Text / No Visual Hierarchy

**Mistake:**
Dense paragraphs with no headings, bullets, or white space.

**Why It's a Problem:**

- Visitors scan, not read (F-pattern eye tracking)
- Cognitive overload → bounce
- Key information buried in text

**Fix:**

- Break up text with **clear headings** (H2, H3 structure)
- Use **bullet points** for lists (not paragraphs)
- **Bold key phrases** within paragraphs for scanning
- **Generous white space:** 80-100px vertical padding between sections
- **Visual hierarchy:** Large headlines → subheadlines → body text

**Better Example:**

```
## Save 60+ Hours Every Month

Stop drowning in spreadsheets and email chaos. MAIS automates:

✓ Lead capture & follow-ups (never miss a weekend inquiry)
✓ Calendar management (zero double-bookings, guaranteed)
✓ Payment processing (get paid faster with automated reminders)

**Result:** More time for hospitality, less time on admin.
```

### What to Avoid from Competitors

- MAIS should be **laser-focused on wedding venues** (specificity builds trust)

**2. Feature Overload**

- Some platforms list 50+ features on landing page (overwhelming)
- MAIS should prioritize **6-8 core features** with depth on feature pages

**3. Corporate Sterile Design**

- Some B2B tools look cold and uninviting (gray, blue, no personality)
- MAIS should balance professionalism with warmth (dusty rose accents, friendly copy)

**4. Buried CTAs**

- Some sites require scrolling 3+ screens before seeing CTA
- MAIS should have **primary CTA above fold** and repeated every 2-3 sections

- If scroll depth <50%: Shorten page, increase visual interest, add sticky CTA bar
- If demo requests >trial signups: Consider making demo secondary CTA (push self-service trial)
- If mobile conversion <3%: Optimize mobile UX, increase CTA button size, simplify forms
