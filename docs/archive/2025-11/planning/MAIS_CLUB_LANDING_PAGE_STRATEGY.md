**Date:** November 19, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This strategy document outlines the complete transformation of the MAIS landing page from a **tenant management SaaS tool** to a **business growth club membership**.

- **NEW:** "Join our business growth club - we succeed when you succeed"

**Key Strategic Changes:**

1. **CTA:** "Start Free Trial" → "Apply to Join the Club"
2. **Value Prop:** Features/tools → Partnership & shared success
3. **Revenue Model:** Fixed monthly fees → Revenue-sharing partnership
4. **Tone:** Transactional → Invitation to exclusive community
5. **Services:** Booking software → AI consulting + scheduling + web design + marketing

## New Landing Page Structure

### 1. Header (Simplified)

**OLD Header:**

```
[Logo] [Features] [Pricing] [How It Works] [Login] [Start Free Trial]
```

**NEW Header:**

```

[Welcome to Macon AI Solutions]
                                          [Log In] [Contact Support] (secondary, muted)
```

**Rationale:**

- Removes traditional SaaS navigation (Features, Pricing)
- "Welcome" language creates inclusive, club-like feel
- Login/Support remain but de-emphasized (not primary conversion path)

```

- **Purpose:** Educational path for hesitant visitors

**Visual:**

- Option 1: Abstract partnership imagery (hands shaking, team collaboration)

- ✅ Adds: "Apply" language (creates exclusivity)
- ✅ Adds: "We're your team" (partnership emphasis)
- ✅ Adds: "Behind the scenes" (support, not DIY tool)

### 3. The Club Advantage (Replaces Stats/Features)

- "Apply" → "Onboard" → "Partnership" (journey narrative)
- "Dedicated AI strategist" (personal touch, not self-service)
- "Small % of sales" (transparent about revenue model)
- "Aligned incentives" (we only succeed if you succeed)

### 8. Pricing & Revenue Model Transparency

**Purpose:** Explain revenue-sharing model clearly to build trust.

**OLD Section:**

```
[Starter: $79/mo] [Professional: $149/mo] [Enterprise: Custom]
```

**NEW Section:**

```
How We Work Together
Aligned incentives. Shared success.
```

**Headline:**

```
We Win When You Win
```

**Subheadline:**

```
Unlike traditional software subscriptions, we take a small percentage of your
revenue—not a fixed monthly fee. This means we're invested in your growth,
not just collecting payments.
```

**The Model:**

**No Upfront Costs**

- "Zero monthly subscription fees"
- "No setup charges or hidden costs"
- "We invest in building your systems"

**Revenue Share**

- "We take X% of your gross revenue"
- "Capped at $[max]/month (you keep scaling, we don't overshare)"
- "Transparent tracking dashboard (you see exactly what we earn)"

**What's Included:**

- ✓ Dedicated AI strategist (monthly sessions)
- ✓ Complete booking & scheduling system
- ✓ Website design & maintenance
- ✓ Marketing automation setup
- ✓ Ongoing support & optimization
- ✓ Access to member community & events

**Why This Model?**

- **For you:** Pay as you grow, no risk when starting
- **For us:** We only succeed if you succeed (aligned incentives)
- **For everyone:** Long-term partnership, not transactional relationship

**Layout:**

- Single-column, centered content (not pricing tiers)
- Use checkmarks for inclusions
- Callout box for "Why This Model?" section

**Transparency Note:**

```
Exact percentage varies by business type (consulting vs. retail vs. services).
During your application, we'll provide a custom quote based on your model.
```

**Rationale:**

- Addresses "how much does this cost?" head-on
- Frames revenue-sharing as benefit (not subscription burden)
- "Capped" provides safety (won't overpay at scale)
- Transparency builds trust (not hiding the model)

---

### 9. FAQ Section

**Purpose:** Address objections and concerns specific to club/partnership model.

**Headline:**

```
Common Questions About Joining
```

**Q1: What if my business doesn't have revenue yet?**
A: We work with pre-revenue startups on a case-by-case basis. During your application, we'll discuss timeline and explore a hybrid model (small base fee + revenue share) until you hit [threshold].

**Q2: How do you track my revenue?**
A: We integrate with your payment processor (Stripe, Square, etc.) to automatically calculate revenue share. You get a transparent dashboard showing exactly what we earn. No manual reporting required.

**Q3: What if I want to leave the club?**
A: No contracts, no lock-in. Cancel anytime with 30 days notice. You keep all systems we built (website, booking pages)—they're yours. We'll export your data and help with transition.

**Q4: Do I have to use all the services?**
A: Nope! Start with what you need (e.g., just booking + website), and add consulting/marketing later as you scale. Your plan is customized to your goals.

**Q5: How is this different from hiring an agency?**
A: Agencies charge $5K-20K+ upfront with no ongoing stake in your success. We build your systems at no upfront cost and only earn when you earn. Plus, you get ongoing support, not just a one-time project.

**Q6: What industries do you work with?**
A: Service-based businesses (consultants, coaches, salons, studios, wellness providers), retail (online and brick-and-mortar), and B2B SaaS. If you sell to customers and need better systems, we can help.

**Q7: How long does onboarding take?**
A: Most members are live within 2-3 weeks (website, booking system, initial automation). AI consulting and marketing ramp up in parallel. You'll start seeing benefits in the first 30 days.

**Q8: What if I already have a website?**
A: Perfect! We'll audit it, optimize for conversions, and integrate booking/payments. If it needs a full redesign, we'll discuss during onboarding. Either way, ongoing maintenance is included.

**Layout:**

- Accordion (expandable Q&A)
- Questions always visible, answers expand on click

### Testimonial Pull Quotes (Expanded)

**Casey, Salon Owner (Full Version)**

> "Before Macon AI, I was manually texting appointment reminders and tracking payments in a notebook. I was losing money to no-shows and spending hours on admin work. Within two weeks of joining the club, I had a beautiful booking website, automated reminders, and a payment system that just works. My revenue is up 30% and I'm working fewer hours. Macon AI is more than tech—they're my business upgrade. This is the team I wish I'd found years ago."

**Robin, Consultant (Full Version)**

> "I'm great at consulting but terrible at marketing and tech. I was losing leads because I didn't have a professional website, and my booking process was a mess of back-and-forth emails. The AI strategist at Macon helped me position my services, built my website in 10 days, and set up a booking flow that just works. I went from lost leads to booked solid in weeks. Now I spend time consulting, not chasing invoices. Worth every penny of the revenue share."

**Alex, Fitness Coach (Full Version)**

> "I didn't have a website, hated tech, and was losing clients to competitors with slick online booking. I almost gave up and went back to a gym job. Then I found Macon AI. They launched my site in 10 days, hooked up payments through Stripe, and automated my scheduling. Now I look professional, my calendar is full, and I'm making more than I ever did as an employee. The best part? I didn't pay anything upfront—they invested in my success. Game-changer."

### FAQ Answers (Detailed)

**Q: What if my business doesn't have revenue yet?**

A: We work with pre-revenue startups on a case-by-case basis. Here's how:

1. **Assessment:** During your application, we'll discuss your business model, timeline to revenue, and funding situation.

2. **Hybrid Model:** For businesses 0-6 months from revenue, we offer a hybrid model:
   - Small base fee ($299-499/month) to cover infrastructure costs
   - Reduced revenue share (X-2%) once you hit [threshold]
   - Base fee credits toward future revenue share

3. **Investment Approach:** If we believe in your model and timeline, we may waive the base fee entirely and invest fully in revenue share.

4. **Timeline Alignment:** We focus on businesses that can generate revenue within 6 months. If your timeline is longer, we'll refer you to partners who specialize in early-stage consulting.

**Why this matters:** We want to set you up for success, not burden you with fees before you're making money. Transparency is key.

---

**Q: How do you track my revenue?**

A: Complete transparency is core to our partnership. Here's exactly how it works:

1. **Integration:** During onboarding, we connect with your payment processor:
   - Stripe (most common)
   - Square (for retail/POS)
   - PayPal (if needed)
   - QuickBooks (for invoiced revenue)

2. **Automatic Calculation:** Our system pulls your gross revenue data and automatically calculates the revenue share percentage. No manual reporting required.

3. **Your Dashboard:** You get a real-time dashboard showing:
   - Total revenue this month
   - Revenue share amount owed
   - Payment schedule (we bill monthly, 15 days after month-end)
   - Historical data (see trends over time)

4. **Privacy:** We only see revenue totals, not individual customer details (names, addresses, etc.). Your client data stays private.

5. **Audit Trail:** Download reports anytime for your accounting/taxes.

**Questions?** Your dedicated strategist can walk you through the dashboard during onboarding.

---

**Q: What if I want to leave the club?**

A: No hard feelings! Here's our exit policy:

1. **No Contracts:** You're never locked in. Cancel anytime with 30 days written notice.

2. **Keep Your Systems:** Everything we built is yours:
   - Your website (we'll transfer hosting to your own account)
   - Booking pages (you own the domain and code)
   - Email templates and automation workflows
   - All content and design assets

3. **Data Export:** We'll export all your data:
   - Customer/lead lists
   - Booking history
   - Analytics & reports
   - Integration settings

4. **Transition Support:** We'll help you migrate to a new provider (if needed) or maintain systems yourself. 1-hour handoff call included.

5. **Final Invoice:** You'll pay the revenue share for the final month (prorated if you leave mid-month), then you're done.

**Why this policy?** We want members who want to be here. If we're not delivering value, you shouldn't be stuck paying us.

## Visual Design Updates

### Color Palette (Keep Existing)

The existing MAIS color palette works perfectly for the club positioning:

**Primary:**

- **Macon Orange:** `#FF6B35` (energy, innovation, action)
- **Macon Navy:** `#004E89` (trust, stability, professionalism)

**Neutrals:**

- **Warm Gray:** `#F5F5F0` (backgrounds)
- **Charcoal:** `#333333` (body text)
- **White:** `#FFFFFF` (card backgrounds)

**Accent:**

- **Macon Orange (Darker):** `#E55A2B` (hover states)

**No changes needed.** The orange/navy combination already conveys partnership and innovation.

---

### Typography (Keep Existing)

**Headlines:** Playfair Display (elegant, authoritative)
**Body:** Inter (modern, readable)

**No changes needed.** Current typography supports both professionalism and approachability.

---

1. **Partnership Imagery**
   - Handshake visuals (not corporate stiff, warm/authentic)
   - Team collaboration photos (strategist + business owner working together)

2. **Member Success Stories**
   - Real member photos (headshots for testimonials)
   - Before/after screenshots (website redesigns, booking systems)
   - Revenue growth charts (anonymized but real)

3. **Service Visuals**
   - AI strategist conducting session (screen share, whiteboard)
   - Booking system in action (calendar, payment confirmation)
   - Website design process (mockups, revisions)

4. **Community/Events**
   - Member workshop photos (if you host them)
   - Virtual meetup screenshots (Zoom calls with members)
   - Slack/community platform screenshots (member interactions)

**REMOVE:**

- Generic SaaS dashboard screenshots (too impersonal)
- Stock photos of people in suits (too corporate)
- Tenant/property management imagery (wrong product!)

### 3. Backend Data Model Updates

**File: `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/prisma/schema.prisma`**

**Current Tenant Model:**

```prisma
model Tenant {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  slug          String   @unique
  name          String
  // Property management fields
  properties    Property[]
  bookings      Booking[]
  tenantUsers   TenantUser[]
}
```

**Needs Conceptual Update:**

- **"Tenant"** should conceptually represent **"Member"** or **"Business"**
- Add revenue-tracking fields:
  - `revenueSharePercentage` (e.g., 5.5 = 5.5%)
  - `revenueShareCap` (max monthly charge)
  - `stripeAccountId` (for tracking their revenue)
  - `revenueStartDate` (when rev-share began)

**New Model: MemberRevenue (Monthly Tracking)**

```prisma
model MemberRevenue {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  tenantId          String   // FK to Tenant (aka Member)
  month             DateTime // First day of month
  grossRevenue      Decimal  // Total revenue
  revenueShareOwed  Decimal  // Amount owed to MAIS
  paid              Boolean  @default(false)
  paidAt            DateTime?

  @@unique([tenantId, month])
}
```

**Action Items:**

- Rename conceptually: Tenant → Member (or keep "Tenant" in code but treat as "business owner")
- Add revenue-tracking fields to Tenant model
- Create MemberRevenue model for monthly billing
- Update seed data to reflect business owner scenarios (not landlords)

---

**File: `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/MAIS/server/src/services/*.service.ts`**

**Current:**

- `catalogService.ts` (for property packages)

- `availabilityService.ts` (for property showings)

**Needs Update To:**

- ✅ Keep `bookingService.ts` (but for member's clients booking services, not property showings)
- ✅ Keep `availabilityService.ts` (member's calendar availability)
- ❌ Remove or repurpose `catalogService.ts` (not relevant to club model)
- ✅ Add `revenueTrackingService.ts` (calculate monthly rev-share)
- ✅ Add `membershipService.ts` (application, onboarding, status)
- ✅ Add `websiteService.ts` (manage member website content)
- ✅ Add `consultingService.ts` (track AI strategy sessions)

- Add revenue-tracking service
- Add membership lifecycle service

## Critical Business Model Questions

Before implementing, clarify these with stakeholders:

### 1. Revenue Share Specifics

- **Q:** What's the exact revenue share percentage?
- **Q:** Is there a cap (max monthly charge)?
- **Q:** How is "gross revenue" defined? (Before or after refunds? Payment processor fees?)
- **Q:** What happens if a member has $0 revenue in a month? (Do they pay anything?)

### 2. Application Process

- **Q:** What's the application form? (Typeform? Custom?)
- **Q:** Who reviews applications? (Manual or automated approval?)
- **Q:** What are the acceptance criteria? (Revenue potential? Industry? Readiness?)
- **Q:** How long does approval take? (24 hours? Instant?)

### 3. Onboarding

- **Q:** Who is the "dedicated AI strategist"? (Existing team member? Hire needed?)
- **Q:** What's the onboarding timeline? (2-3 weeks realistic?)
- **Q:** What's delivered in onboarding? (Website + booking system + first consultation?)

### 4. Service Scope

- **Q:** Are all services included for all members? (Or tiered/à la carte?)
- **Q:** How much website maintenance is included? (Unlimited changes? Capped hours?)
- **Q:** How often are AI consulting sessions? (Monthly? On-demand?)

### 5. Legal & Compliance

- **Q:** What legal entity structure? (Partnership? Service agreement?)
- **Q:** What's in the "Revenue Share Agreement"? (Draft needed?)
- **Q:** What about members in different states/countries? (Tax implications?)
- **Q:** How are chargebacks/refunds handled? (Who eats the cost?)

### 6. Technical Feasibility

- **Q:** Does current tech stack support multi-service architecture?
- **Q:** Is Stripe Connect the right choice for revenue tracking?
- **Q:** How will member websites be managed? (Custom CMS? Webflow? WordPress?)
- **Q:** Can current booking system handle different service types? (consulting vs. appointments vs. classes)

## Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

**Primary KPIs:**

- **Application Conversion Rate:** Target 8-12% (visitor → application submitted)
- **Approval Rate:** Target 60-70% (applications reviewed → accepted)
- **Onboarding Completion:** Target 90% (accepted → fully onboarded)
- **Member Retention:** Target 80% at 6 months (churn <20%)
- **Revenue Per Member:** Target $X/month average

**Secondary Metrics:**

- **Application Quality:** % requiring follow-up questions (lower is better)
- **Time to First Value:** Days from acceptance to member sees benefit
- **Member Satisfaction (NPS):** Target 50+ (promoters > detractors)
- **Website Traffic:** Compare pre/post launch (club positioning should attract different audience)

---

## Final Recommendations

### 1. Start with Existing Customers

If you have existing MAIS users (tenant management customers), consider:

- **Grandfather them:** Offer club membership as an upgrade
- **Migration path:** "Your booking system is now part of a bigger club—here's what else you get"
- **Test case:** Use existing customers as first club members (validate model)

### 2. Phased Rollout

Don't flip the switch overnight:

- **Week 1-2:** Update landing page only (test messaging)
- **Week 3-4:** Launch application process (manual review)
- **Week 5-8:** Onboard first 5-10 members (refine process)
- **Week 9+:** Scale marketing, automate approval

### 3. Transparency is Key

Since revenue-sharing is unusual:

- **Create explainer video:** "How our revenue share works" (3 min)
- **Dashboard mockups:** Show what members see (before they apply)
- **Case study:** "How we helped [Member X] grow—and what we earned"

### 4. Community is Differentiator

"Club" implies community:

- **Member Slack:** Private channel for peer support
- **Monthly workshops:** Guest experts, AI training, best practices
- **Member directory:** Help members network/refer each other
